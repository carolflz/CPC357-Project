# Smart Irrigation System for Urban Gardens

## Overview
Urban farming has emerged as a sustainable trend, allowing individuals to utilize urban spaces like balconies, rooftops, and small plots of land to grow plants, fruits, flowers, and vegetables. However, urban farmers often face challenges such as limited space and resources, lack of farming knowledge, and inefficient water management.

This **Smart Irrigation System** addresses these challenges by leveraging IoT technologies to automate watering based on soil moisture levels. The system aligns with **UN SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities**, promoting sustainable urban farming practices.

## Features
- **Automated Watering**: Soil moisture sensors detect when plants need water and activate the water pump accordingly.
- **Rain Monitoring**: A rain sensor module detects rainfall to optimize water usage.
- **Rainwater Collection**: A water level sensor tracks the containerâ€™s water level, and a servo motor controls the container's cover to collect rainwater when levels are low.
- **Weather Prediction**: The DHT11 sensor collects temperature and humidity data to predict rain, ensuring efficient irrigation scheduling.
- **Resource Conservation**: The system ensures plants are only watered when needed, conserving water and supporting urban farming.
